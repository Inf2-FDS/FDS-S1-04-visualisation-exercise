# FDS S1 Week 4 Formative visualisation excercise

## Important: how to run Jupyter so you can submit the exercise

This exercise (and Coursework 1) require you to submit a PDF generated in a particular way, which uses LaTeX behind the scenes.

The recommended way of generating this format is to use Notable with
the **Jupyter Classic (Legacy)** notebook server. 

**Due to an upgrade at the start of Semester 1, the default server in
Noteable does not work.**

[The instructions for running
labs](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-09/FDS-Labs.pdf)
work need to be changed by selecting the **Jupyter Classic (Legacy)**
notebook server:

1. Go to the FDS Learn page and navigate to **Books & Tools**.

2. Click on the **Noteable** link.

3. Noteable will automatically open in a new tab. The next screen may
  say "Loading...". There may also be a message saying "Your
  browser may have blocked the opening of the new window; try clicking
  the button below to open 'Noteable'." If so, click on the button.

4. Once Noteable has loaded, you should see text saying "Please select
  a personal notebook server". Ensure **Jupyter Classic (Legacy)** is
  selected and click **Start**.

To get the visualisation exercise into Noteable, use the  **+GitRepo** button to clone `https://github.com/Inf2-FDS/FDS-S1-04-visualisation-exercise` .

### How do I get out of the wrong notebook server?

If you have managed to start the standard notebook server
(JupyterLab), you can switch to the **Jupyter Classic (Legacy)** server
by clicking on the **Noteable** link at the top right of the screen (see screenshot below),
closing the server and starting Jupyter Classic (Legacy).
