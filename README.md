# FDS S1 Week 4 Formative visualisation excercise

## Important: how to run Jupytyer so you can submit the exercise

This exercise (and Coursework 1) require you to submit a PDF in a
particular format (see below for details).

The recommended way of generating this format is to use Notable with
the "Jupyter Classic (Legacy)" notebook server. 

**Due to an upgrade at the start of Semester 1, the default server in
Noteable does not work.**

[The instructions for running
labs](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-09/FDS-Labs.pdf)
work need to be changed by selecting the "Jupyter Classic (Legacy)"
notebook server:

1. Go to the FDS Learn page and navigate to **Books & Tools**.

2. Click on the **Noteable** link.

3. Noteable will automatically open in a new tab. The next screen may
  say "Loading\dots". There may also be a message saying "Your
  browser may have blocked the opening of the new window; try clicking
  the button below to open 'Noteable'." If so, click on the button.

4. Once Noteable has loaded, you should see text saying "Please select
  a personal notebook server". Ensure **Jupyter Classic (Legacy)** is
  selected and click **Start**.

The clone this repository, using "+GitRepo" button as described in the
Lab instructions.

### How do I get out of the wrong server?

If you have managed to start the standard notebook server
(JupyterLab), you can switch to the "Jupyter Classic (Legacy)" server
by clicking on the "Noteable" link at the top right of the screen,
closing the server and starting Jupyter Classic (Legacy).
