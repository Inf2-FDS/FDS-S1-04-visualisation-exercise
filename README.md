# FDS S1 Week 4 Formative visualisation excercise

## Important: how to run Jupyter so you can submit the exercise

This exercise requires you to submit a PDF to Gradescope. The PDF needs to be generated in a particular way, which uses LaTeX behind the scenes.

The recommended way of generating this format is to [use Noteable, as described in the lab instructions on OpenCourse](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/inf2-fds/labs/noteable).
